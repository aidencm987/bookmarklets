What they are:
Bookmarklets are essentially "one-click" tools that add functionality to your browser by running JavaScript code.

How they work:
Instead of directing you to a new webpage, they execute the JavaScript code embedded in the bookmark on the page you're currently viewing.

What they can do:
Bookmarklets can be used for various tasks, such as highlighting text, executing APIs, modifying website layouts, or automating tasks.

How to create them:
To create a bookmarklet, you need to write some JavaScript code and then save it as a bookmark in your browser with a javascript: URL.

How to use mine:
To use my code as a bookmarklet, create a bookmark and instead of saving a URL, in the URL input box type "javascript:" and then after the colon ":", copy and paste my code and click save. Once you have saved it, when you click the bookmark, instead of directing you to a new webpage, it will run the code.
